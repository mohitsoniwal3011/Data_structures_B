    /*there are two types of sorting techniques
    1)internal sort
    2)external sort

    ->stable sort :-if the relative order of the identical keys is the same
        in both sorted as well as unsorted list
       unstable sort :-if the relative order of the identical key is not the same in
        sorted and unsorted lists

     ->Indirect sort :- if the data of the list(record) is not moved physically but
        only the pointers are moved (we maintain an array of pointers )
       Direct sort :- if the data is physically moved and pointers are not changed
      (if the records to be sorted is very large then direct sort can be an expensive task )


      ->In-place sort (minimal storage sort):- these methods do not require any extra storage space to sort the data
        except some pointers or variables. so the space complexity of these type of sort methods
        are O(1) .examples are :-


      ->sort efficiency :-depends on
        1) Coding time
        2) Space requirement
        3) run time/execution time
